# About

This project is used for workshop purposes and contains examples of (hopefully) good practices for bash scripting.

# Examples

## Debugging

Source: scripts/debugging\_easy\_example.sh and scripts/debugging\_tougher\_example.sh                                      

The point: Debugging is hard in bash.

Assignment: Find the bugs.

## Syntax

Source: scripts/syntax.sh

The point: You can do similar things in different ways in bash.

Assignment: Try out the different ifs and explain the differences, when to use, and what you prefer.

## Organizing of files

Source: The project tree

The point: Understand convention over configuration and why it is important to put different types of files in different places.

Assignment: How would you organize your files when you have specific scripts for different projects residing in different folders.

## Functions and configuration

Source: include/common\_functions.sh include/common\_config.sh

The point: Reduce complexity, enhance testability, and reuseability.

Assignment: Go through the functions and try to understand them. Write your own function.

## Return values and return statuses

Source: include/common\_functions.sh

The point: Understand the differences betwwen a return value and a return status.

Assignment: Revisit the functions and explain what the different functions return (values and/or statuses)

## Including common functionality

Source: include/includes.sh

The point: Understand reusability by sourcing other files.

Assignment: Write a function in a file and include and use it in a script.

## Debugging revisited

Source: include/common\_functions.sh

The point: Understand how you can debug your scripts without executing "dangerous" commands. Understand the -x and the set +e set -e constructs.

Assignment: Write debugging for a function or script where it is lacking.

## Simple deploy and rollback

Source: scripts/deploy.sh and scripts/rollback.sh

The point: These scripts are not very testable.

Assignment: Make the scripts testable.
